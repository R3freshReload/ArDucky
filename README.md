# ArDucky
A "Rubber Ducky" like script for Digispark Adruinos


## Information
* All the code you are going to need is in the Arducky.ino file.
* You can skip the execution of the ducky script by shorting pin 2 and ground

## Usage / Installation
Edit the runConfig() function in Arducky.ino to do what ever you want.

To install you need to set you board (Board Configs can be found here: https://github.com/digistump/DigistumpArduino) and the correct programmer has to be selected (I used USBtinyISP)

Then you should be able to compile and upload you script
